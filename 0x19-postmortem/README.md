MY FIRST POSTMORTEM
Issue Summary
Duration: The outage persisted for three hours, commencing at 10:00 AM and concluding at 1:00 PM on May 10, 2024 (UTC timezone).
Impact: Our primary web application was rendered inaccessible to approximately 80% of our users, who encountered slow loading times and intermittent errors throughout the duration of the outage.
Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was traced back to a critical hardware failure in one of our database servers.

Timeline
9:55 AM: Anomaly detected through monitoring alerts highlighting a significant increase in error rates and sluggish response times.
10:00 AM: Engineering team promptly notified of the issue.
10:05 AM: Investigation commenced, with initial focus on both frontend and backend systems to identify potential points of failure.
10:30 AM: Initial assumption suggested a probable network connectivity issue, prompting thorough investigation.
11:00 AM: Exhaustive examination of network connectivity revealed no anomalies or disruptions.
11:30 AM: Attention shifted to database infrastructure, where the faulty server was identified as the source of the problem.
12:00 PM: Incident escalated to senior engineering personnel for additional expertise and support.
12:30 PM: Hardware malfunction in the database server conclusively identified as the underlying cause of the disruption.
1:00 PM: Service restoration achieved through replacement of the malfunctioning hardware components.

Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: The outage stemmed from a critical hardware failure within the database server, resulting in its unresponsiveness.
Resolution: The issue was effectively resolved by promptly replacing the faulty hardware components and restoring full functionality to the database server.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes: 
Implementation of redundant database servers to mitigate single points of failure and enhance system reliability.
Enhancement of monitoring systems to facilitate quicker detection and response to hardware failures.
Tasks to Address the Issue: 
  1. Procurement of additional database server hardware to establish redundancy in the infrastructure.
  2. Review and adjustment of monitoring thresholds to enable swifter detection of hardware failures.
  3. Conduct comprehensive review and refinement of disaster recovery procedures to ensure readiness for future incidents.

These corrective measures aim to minimize the risk of recurrence of similar outages and enhance the overall resilience and reliability of our systems, thereby ensuring a smoother and more uninterrupted user experience in the future.
